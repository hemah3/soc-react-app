# Separation of Concerns
Separation of concerns is a concept that is widely used in programming. It states that logic that performs different actions should not be groupled or combined together.

To achieve a separation of concerns we have two types of components:

Container components - **Order Container component** 
These are the components that provide, create, or hold data for the children components.

Presentational components - **Order list component.**
These are the components whose primary responsibility is to present the data on the UI.
